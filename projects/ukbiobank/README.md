# Dissertaion and Internship on the UKBiobank
Due to the nature of the dissertaion and strict licensing where a lot of code/data were stored on Cluster Machines, I am not able to provide a full project with code and outputs. Instead, I will show what and contextualise it.


## Who are the UKBiobank


## Nature of the dissertaion
Dissertations at Newcasle University are done a little differently, they are a large project then the final document is a write-up. I chose Data Science, which was not a topic taught at Newcastle, so a lot of the project was to understand the fields as well as the tools and technologies needed to complete the project.
