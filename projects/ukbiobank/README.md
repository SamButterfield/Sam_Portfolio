# Dissertaion and Internship on the UKBiobank
Due to the nature of the dissertaion and strict licensing where a lot of code/data were stored on Cluster Machines, I am not able to provide a full project with code and outputs. Instead, I will showcase what I can and contextualise it.


## Who are the UKBiobank
The UKBioBank is a charity organisation that collates medical
information and supplies it to researchers to better the treatment and diagnoses of a wide range of
diseases. Between 2006 and 2010 the UKBioBank recruited over 500,000 volunteer participants
between the ages of 40-69 into a longitudinal study. Upon entry to the study a range of data was
collected, and since then there have been additional datasets gathered that contain other medicalrelated information for the original participants 


## Nature of the dissertaion
Dissertations at Newcasle University are not done in the traditional manner, they are a large project then the final document is closer to a write-up than a thesis. I chose Data Science, which was not a topic taught at Newcastle, so a lot of the project was to understand the field as well as the tools and technologies needed to complete the project. [Click Here](https://github.com/SamButterfield/DissertationCodeDump/blob/master/sb_dissertation_FINAL_V3.pdf) to see my full dissertation document that was marked at 80/100 (upper first class).



## The main achievment
At the begining of the year I was handed a bunch of datasets with no real goal apart from gain a understanding through Exploratory Data Analysis
