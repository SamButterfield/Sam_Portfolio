# Yin Yang Neural Network (NN)

**Project Aim** - A third-year assignment to tune a NN to predict the colour of points on a graph to depict a the Yin Yang.


**Project Summary** - The datasets were provided by the module leader, the only preprocessing done was checking to see if any points were duplicated to create a bias on the model but other than that, the datasets were clean. I used an iterative approach to tune the network by changing certain hyperparameters, I used Tensor Flow which greatly sped-up the training time. To get the split in the Yin Yang was relatively easy, but to get the model to recognise the dots on each side proved to be difficult.


**Project Outcome** - I achieved a 98% accuracy on an independent test set and it was a good introductory project into NN's and the whole dicipline off Deep Learning.
