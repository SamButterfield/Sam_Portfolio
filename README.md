## Education
I graduated from Newcastle University with a First Class Honours Degree in Computer Science with a year-long Industrial Placement working for Toyota GB in there Systems Department in Summer of 2020.


The first two years of the degree focused on traditional Computer Science topics like Programming (Java/Python), System Architecture, Maths for Computing, Web Development (Basics), Operating Systems, Databases and Team Project where we built an Android App.


The final year comprised of optional modules where I elected to study Distributed Systems, Web Technologies (RESTful API), Systems and Network Security (Theory), Serverside Management (Apache/AWS), Biologically Inspired Computing (Machine/Deep Learning), Bioinformatics, Human-Computer-Interaction.


For my Dissertation theme, I decided to choose Data Science, where I got work on a live research project using 500,000 peoples electronic health records.


## Work Experience
**Toyota GB** - As a student at Toyota a lot of the year was dedicated to learning The Toyota Way and how the company operates, this was a fantastic parallel to my Computer Science degree as it taught me a lot about how corporations operate and function in general as well as develop my soft skills in a way working at university cannot do. The role was primarily Project-Based where I worked on everything from designing SharePoint sites to meet business needs, to coordinating SOx (Sarbanes Oxley) Audits,  which required are a large amount of versatility. But the role had one BAU task which was running a Business Intelligence report for the business on part-exchange data and handling any specific questions/queries the business recipients may have.


**Data Science Internship at Newcastle University** - My Dissertation focussed on Big Data Analysis of the datasets provided by the UKBiobank and the Engineering of new a Feature that contributed to a research paper, this internship primarily focussed on continuing this work but also moved onto predictive analysis and machine learning.
