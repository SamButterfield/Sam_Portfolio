The first two years of the degree focused on traditional Computer Science topics like Programming (Java/Python), System Architecture, Maths for Computing, Web Development (Basics), Operating Systems, Databases and Team Project where we built an Android App.

The final year comprised of optional modules where I elected to study Distributed Systems, Web Technologies (RESTful API), Systems and Network Security (Theory), Serverside Management (Apache/AWS), Biologically Inspired Computing (Machine/Deep Learning), Bioinformatics, Human-Computer-Interaction.

For my Dissertation theme, I decided to choose Data Science, where I got work on a live research project using 500,000 peoples electronic health records.
