## Education
I graduated from Newcastle University in the summer of 2020 with a First Class Honours Degree in Computer Science, this was a 4-year course with a year long industrial placement at Toyota GB working in the Systems Department.


The first two years of the degree focused on traditional Computer Science topics like Programming (Java/Python), System Architecture, Maths for Computing, Web Development (Basics), Operating Systems, Networks, Databases and a Team Project where we built an Android App.


The final year comprised of optional modules where I elected to study Distributed Systems, Web Technologies (RESTful API), Systems and Network Security (Theory), Serverside Management (Apache/AWS), Biologically Inspired Computing (Machine/Deep Learning), Bioinformatics, Human-Computer-Interaction.


For my Dissertation theme, I decided to choose Data Science, where I got work on a live research project using 500,000 peoples electronic health records. This was my first exposure to Data Science as an area of study and it was a vast project that touched on most topics within Data Science.


## Work Experience
**Toyota GB** - As a student at Toyota a lot of the year was dedicated to learning The Toyota Way and how the company operates, this was a fantastic parallel to my Computer Science degree as it taught me a lot about how corporations operate and function in general as well as develop my soft skills in a way working at university cannot do. The role was primarily Project-Based where I worked on everything from designing SharePoint sites to meet business needs, to coordinating SOx (Sarbanes Oxley) Audits,  which required are a large amount of versatility. But the role had one BAU task which was running a Business Intelligence report for the business on part-exchange data and handling any specific questions/queries the business recipients may have.


**Data Science Internship at Newcastle University** - The main piece of my dissertation was engineering a new feature that could define an individuals ability to be active at a point in time using events within there electronic health records. This feature was then used in a research paper that looked at how effective individuals phenotypes are at predicting Type 2 Diabetes, the feature I engineered was used to exclude individuals who were too unwell to be active. In addition to carrying on the work from my dissertation I got to work with dataset aggregations, dataset cleaning, feature analysis, correlation analysis and implementing machine learning algorithms. Due to the Corona Virus Pandemic, this was all done remotely, which was a great opportunity to gain experience working within a larger team in this way.
