## Titanic
**Project Aim** - To undertake the Kaggle Titanic challenge to get a starting experience of a start-to-finish data project with cleaning, feature engineering and predictive analysis. Additionally, I will use JupyterNotebook to gain experience of using local .ipynb files and working with Github.
**Project Summary** - Allowed me to do a full analysis of a well known static dataset
